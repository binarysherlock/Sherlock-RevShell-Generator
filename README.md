**generator.py**<br>
=> I wrote this script while trying to learn Python from a Pentester's Perspective. This script can be used to generate powershell script which will provide a reverse shell without getting detected by the Windows Defender.

**Usage**<br>
=> $ python3 generator.py hostname/ip:port
